some useful datastructure implementations

##  Stacks
- ImmutableStack
  - Something I saw in a Kevlin Henney video and thought it was pretty cool. The actual video https://youtu.be/APUCMSPiNh4?t=2673

##  Heaps
  - Binary Heap

## Trees
- BinarySearchTree
  - Avl implementation which permits duplicate elements
 
- PrefixTrie
  - Pretty basic implementation of a Re'trie'val tree which can match prefixes.
- SuffixTrie
  - A simple extension of the PrefixTrie which can also match suffixes at the cost of double the nodes. I'm working on a more advanced version.
